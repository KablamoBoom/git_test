Cheatsheet
This is a reference list of the most commonly used Git commands. Try to familiarize yourself with the commands so that you can eventually remember them all:
    • Commands related to a remote repository: 
        ◦ git clone git@github.com:KablamoBoom/git_test.git
        ◦ git push (origin main)
    • Commands related to the workflow: 
        ◦ git add .
        ◦ git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different" 
    • Commands related to checking status or log history 
        ◦ git status
        ◦ git log
The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.
For example,
    • git add . is read as git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory; 
    • git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and 
    • git status is read as git | status | (no destination).
